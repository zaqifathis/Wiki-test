Quantity generation can take quite some time, and for some models 10x as much time!

If you are using BIMvie.ws as a frontend:
1. Goto Server | Installed Plugin Bundles
2. Click on the "IfcOpenShell-BIMserver-plugin" plugin bundle
3. Click on the "IfcOpenShell" plugin
4. Disable "Calculate Quantities" and hit "Save"

Obviously the effect of this will only be visible for new checkins.
