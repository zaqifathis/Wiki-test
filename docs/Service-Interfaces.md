The `Service Interfaces` are a set of defined interfaces for interaction with BIMserver. These interfaces are defined as (heavily annotated) Java interfaces.

In BIMserver 1.3/1.4 a lot of methods were moved to interfaces that are prefixed with `org.buildingsmart.bimsie1`. In BIMserver 1.5 those methods have been moved back to the original interfaces.
