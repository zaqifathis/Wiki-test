**Dear bimserver.org community member**

In the past decade the BIM server grew from a small Open Source research initiative into a more sophisticated Open Source framework with a rich ecosystem of accompanying tools and plugins. We realize that beside research organizations also commercial organizations are interested in the use of the BIM Server. This justifies the question how we want to proceed with the BIM Server in a way that itâ€™s available for both the research projects as Open Source, but also as a technical stable system and fully supported that is sustainable from a commercial and financial point of view (i.e. dual license). We hope that you will contribute to our short questionnaire and tell us about the experiences of you / your organization with BIM server and its accompanying tools. 
To get a better understanding about the nature of the community, their opinions and ideas about bimserver.org, we have composed a short survey. 

This should not take more than **10 min.** of your time.

We appreciated your cooperation very much, thank you in advance! 
Thank you to the many of the core community (**Ruben, Leon, Thomas, Lars, Helga, Klaus**) for their support on compiling this survey!
